            In order to keep your zbAction installation as secure as possible. We recommend that you follow the following guidelines:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Never share your zbAction password with anybody.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Only add modifications you trust.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep all zbAction modification code below the zbAction code.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Don't touch the zbAction code unless you know what you are doing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you feel an added modification is not safe, remove it from your zbAction account <b>first</b>. After that, remove it from your board template. Removing a modification from your account results in an immediate change. Removing a modification from your board template does not&mdash;a page reload is required in order for the change to take effect.
                </li>
            </ul>
