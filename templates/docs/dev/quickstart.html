            Creating a zbAction modification is straightforward and easy. In this quickstart guide, we'll be creating a minimalistic poke modification similar to Facebook's poke feature. The first thing we need to do is hook into zbAction. We can do that by calling <span class="literal">zbAction.ready</span>.
        </p>
        {{ code.literal('zbAction.ready(api_key, function);', lang='javascript') }}
        <p>
            <span class="literal">zbAction.ready</span> takes two arguments: an API key and an execution function. When zbAction is done loading, execution functions are called and passed an instance of <span class="literal">zbAction</span>. Let's say we have some code like this:
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_hello_world.js') }}
        <p>
            In the above example, when zbAction is finished loading, the execution function will automatically be called and an alert with the text "Hello World!" will appear.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Before we go any further, we should write the code to place a poke button on user profiles. Let's modify the previous example to do that.
        </p>
        {{ code.source('example/docs/quickstart_place_button.js') }}
        <p>
            Now that we have that done, we can start interfacing with zbAction. zbAction provides two standard functions for interfacing with it. These functions are: <span class="literal">zbAction.register</span> and <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span>. <span class="literal">zbAction.register</span> allows you to register action event handlers specific to your modification while <span class="literal">zbAction.send</span> allows you to send actions to be received by your modification. Here's an example:
